# 4-Floored-Elevator

Here is the code for both original and remake. What's the difference?

# Original

You need the following hardware:
H-bridge
planetary Gear DC Motor
4x Push Button
Arduino
Arduino IDE

The original Code, is basically a Trial and Error of how long the elevator should stop for each floor. 

# Remake

You need the following hardware:
H-bridge
planetary Gear DC Motor
3x Push Button
Limit Switch
7-Segment Display 
3x LEDs
Arduino
Arduino IDE

The Remake is basically where its one less button, has more features as add on, and it tells the elevator exactly where it should stop
because of the Limit Switch.
